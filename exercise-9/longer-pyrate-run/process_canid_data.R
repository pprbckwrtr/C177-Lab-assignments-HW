```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
source("~/PyRate/pyrate_utilities.r")

# we need to give the utilities a list of extant species
extant_dogs = c("Canis rufus","Canis lupus","Canis aureus","Canis latrans","Canis mesomelas","Canis anthus","Pseudalopex gymnocercus","Canis adustus","Canis familiaris")

# use the extract.ages.pbdb() function in pyrate_utilities to reformat our dataset...
extract.ages.pbdb(file= "canid_occ.csv",extant_species=extant_dogs)

# you should see the following output:

# "This function is currently being tested - caution with the results!"
# replicate 1
# PyRate input file was saved in:  ./canid_occ_PyRate.py 


# TO DO:
# save the file as "process_canid_data.R" in exercise-9

# quit rstudio
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
